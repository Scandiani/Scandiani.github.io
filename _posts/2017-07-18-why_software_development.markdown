Software development has proven to be a simultaneously challenging and creative process; the following components are essential to my satisfaction in any pursuit. However, before I had understood anything about software development I had a completely different focus. I've always been an analytical person, yet I never believed that I could put that to particular use in an imaginative way. I've also had an interest in anything to do with computers for a long period of time. It took one particular conversation to spark action. 

I was working at my job at the time, casually discussing college pathways with a group of female coworkers. I began to mention my interest in math and sciences, and received a crowd of confused looks. They proceeded to tell me they had no interest in such subjects because they weren't proficient in them and the subjects weren't artistic. This immediately gained my attention, and I made my first decision to challenge that idea by taking a java college course. I gave myself a quest to find the art in logic, and quickly I did. I fell in love with the perspective I gained--that at my fingertips I could craft an entire world. Software development feels like the act of making abstract concepts concrete.  

On the other hand, I also noticed that I was being challenged in completely new ways every single class. This only added to my curiosity and enthusiasm for software development. I began to feel addicted to learning as much as I could about the language I was focused on. When I was able to get my programs to pass I let out sighs of relief like I never had before. Software development can be just as challenging as it is gratifying. 

All in all, I decided to learn software development because it is extremely thought-provoking and artistic in nature. Now that I am continuing my learning process I even hope to be a guide to others who may feel it beyond them, especially young women. I enjoy the opportunity to use my enthusiasm to shed light on the imaginative aspects of it. There truly is nothing more exciting than software development!
